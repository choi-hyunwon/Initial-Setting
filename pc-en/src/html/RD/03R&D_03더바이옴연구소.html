                    <p>Human microbiome refers to the genomes of all microorganisms, including bacteria, fungi, and viruses, that inhabit the human body.
                        It is affected by food, age, genetic factors, medications, and other environmental factors, and plays an important role in maintaining good health.
                        When the microbiome is out of balance, it can lead to obesity, diabetes, asthma, atopy, heart disease, high blood pressure, autism, and cancer.
                        Therefore, modulating the composition of the microbiome is a potential strategy to prevent diseases.<br/><br/>

                        The Biome Institute was established to understand microbiomes and ultimately improve human health.<br/>
                        Macrogen is committed to playing an important role in microbiome research and stepping up as a global leader in the development of microbiome-targeted treatment. </p>
