It is able to predict the genetic diseases of your companion animals at an early stage, so you can prevent diseases through customized care solutions such as improvement of eating habits and exercise. It is also possible to prevent loss and abandonment of companion animals by proving individual identification and blood ties with the corresponding DNA.</p>

If there is a family history of genetic disease or signs of symptoms, testing can help you in early diagnosis, prevention, treatment, and health management, even though there are no symptoms at the moment. The test is designed to extract the DNA of companion animals and analyzes whether there are genetic mutations or structural abnormalities related to specific diseases to confirm the possibility of genetic diseases. As genetic information composed of DNA, a gene has a special command system encoded to make proteins. However, when a gene is mutated due to various causes, the normal protein is not formed, which causes a disease. These mutations are either inherited from parents or acquired, and myPETGENE can obtain genetic disease information by identifying mutation factors inherited from parents.</p>

DNA certificate, also known as DNA profiling, is a method of extracting DNA from a companion animal's sample to reveal their unique genetic pattern. It compares and analyzes the genetic locus of two samples to identify whether the DNA is from the same object, and the DNA is stored for future confirmation in case the animal ever goes missing. It is also used as a certificate to verify the genotype of companion animals in case of disputes of ownership for companion animals.</p>

Just as human chromosomes identify XX as female and XY as male, the sex chromosomes of birds consist of Z and W. A bird's sperm contains one Z chromosome, and the egg contains either Z or W, so the gender is determined by the egg. Females have ZW with heterozygous chromosomes, and males have ZZ with homozygous chromosomes. Therefore, it is possible to distinguish the gender by checking the sex chromosome differences between males and females through DNA analysis.</p>
