    <p class="desc">Macrogen provides various gene analysis services using precise DNA microarray technology. Known by various terms such as DNA chip, biochip, and gene-array, microarray is a technology that measures the expression pattern of genes and verifies whether there is a mutation by arranging invisible probes on a chip and reacting DNA, RNA, protein, etc. For microarray analysis, correct execution of tests and the capacity to correctly select significant genetic information from test results, as well as the technology to integrate probes at high density and produce them in a small chip form, are essential.
        <br><br>
        Macrogen is the only company in Korea that has all the products of Illumina, Affymetrix and Agilent, which are the main suppliers of microarray products. Based on this equipment, we offer genetic testing services for research purposes such as mRNA, miRNA, SNP, CGH, and DNA methylation. Based on extensive test and analysis experience for research customers around the world, Macrogen guarantees that it will provide only high-quality data results.</p>
