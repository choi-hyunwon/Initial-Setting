  <p class="desc">GEM (Genetically Engineered Mouse) is a laboratory mouse that has had certain genes inserted, removed, or modified using gene-editing technologies. Such mice are widely used in biological and medical research to identify the functions of human genes. Macrogen’s main GEM service offers Transgenic Mice and Knock-Out/Knock-In mice. A Transgenic Mouse is one in which a specific gene has been inserted to study the function of that gene. A Knock-Out Mouse is a genetically engineered mouse in which the expression of a target gene has been suppressed by removing a specific gene, and a Knock-In Mouse is a genetically engineered mouse in which the expression of a target gene can be adjusted or explored by modifying a certain gene. Macrogen also offers a wide range of other GEM-related services including mass reproduction, mouse line recovery, embryo freezing and reproduction to live, and KO/TG mouse maintenance. To ensure process efficiency, our genetically engineered mice are produced after a thorough experiment design process with our clients. We provide a customized partial process service to meet various client requirements, and our strict quarantine system ensures that all mice are maintained and supplied in a specific pathogen free (SPF) state.

    CRISPR-Cas9, Macrogen's flagship service, is made by attaching a guide RNA that functions as a guide and Cas9 protein that cuts DNA. In principle, the position to cut and edit the DNA sequence varies, depending on the design of the guide RNA that finds the target DNA. Macrogen is developing gene editing technology with Seoul National University Hospital and the most prestigious research institutes around the world, including the Broad Institute co-founded by MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) and Harvard University. Furthermore, we have secured over 50 CRISPR gene editing technologies owned by the Broad Institute in America.</p>
